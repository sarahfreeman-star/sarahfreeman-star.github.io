                <p>
                "Sherlock" is a British crime television series produced by the BBC and co-created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss. The series is based on the original Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1887). 
                Benedict Cumberbatch plays Sherlock Holmes, and Martin Freeman plays Doctor Watson. 13 episodes have been produced, with four three-part series airing from 2010 to 2017, and a special episode that aired on 1 January 2016. 
                The series is set in the present day, while the one-off special features a Victorian period fantasy resembling the original Holmes stories.

                The series "Sherlock" depicts "consulting detective" Sherlock Holmes solving various mysteries in modern-day London. Holmes is assisted by his flatmate and friend, Dr. John Watson, who has returned from military service in Afghanistan with the Royal Army Medical Corps. 
                Although Metropolitan Police Service Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade (Rupert Graves) and others are suspicious of Holmes at first, over time, his exceptional intellect and bold powers of observation persuade them of his value. 
                In part through Watson's blog documenting their adventures, Holmes becomes a reluctant celebrity with the press reporting on his cases and eccentric personal life. Both ordinary people and the British government ask for his help. 
                Although the series depicts a variety of crimes and perpetrators, Holmes' conflict with nemesis Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) is a recurring feature. Molly Hooper (Louise Brealey), a pathologist at St. Bart's Hospital, occasionally assists Holmes in his cases. 
                Other recurring roles include Una Stubbs as Mrs. Hudson, Holmes and Watson's landlady, and series co-creator Mark Gatiss as Holmes' elder brother Mycroft.
